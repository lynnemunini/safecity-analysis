# SafeCity Machine Learning Model
This repository contains the code for the SafeCity Machine Learning Model. The goal of this project is to analyze crime reports to identify the most common patterns and provide insights that can be used to identify areas prone to crime and to predict the likelihood of a crime occurring in a given area. The model is trained using a dataset of crime reports from the city of Nairobi. 

## Important Note
The data used to train the model is fake and was generated using Faker and GeoPy. The model is not intended to be used in production and is only meant to be used as a proof of concept.
